# 💫 About Me:
🔭 I’m currently working on an end-to-end Machine Learning project where my goal is to simulate how a data scientist works in a real industry setting. I start by understanding the business problem, then perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering. After that, I train multiple machine learning models, compare their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics, and fine-tune the best model using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. Finally, I focus on interpreting the results and converting them into meaningful business insights.<br>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on data science and machine learning projects involving structured data, predictive modeling, and business-driven insights. I’m particularly interested in working with teams where I can contribute to data cleaning, EDA, model development, and evaluation, and also learn best practices used in real industry projects.<br>🤝 I’m looking for help with improving my end-to-end machine learning project, particularly in feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and validating the model using proper cross-validation techniques.<br>🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning using Python, scikit-learn, and related data science libraries, while strengthening my understanding of model evaluation, cross-validation, and feature engineering.<br>💬 Ask me about building end-to-end machine learning pipelines using Python.<br>⚡ Fun fact I find data cleaning more satisfying than model training—it’s where most real problems are solved.
